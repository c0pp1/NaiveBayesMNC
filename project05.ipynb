They are everywhere in our daily life, and come especially from\nsocial media platforms and applications in the online world. Being able to distinguish fake contents form\nreal news is today one of the most serious challenges facing the news industry.  \n[Naive Bayes classifiers][1] are powerful algorithms that are used for text data analysis and are connected\nto classification tasks of text in multiple classes.\nThe goal of the project is to implement a __Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier__ in `R` and test its perfor-\nmances in the classification of social media posts.\nThe suggested data set is available on [Kaggle][2]\n\n[1]: https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/13bayes.pdf \"C.
